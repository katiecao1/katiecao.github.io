                                Many of these side projects that I did encompass my personal interest: Wine and dining, biking, and the financial market. There's nothing I love more than being able to apply what I do for work and what I learn in school to a topic that people care about, to make machine learning and statistics less scary and more accessible. Something that we could all relate to.
                                <br><br>
                                <b>1. Grubhub vs. Uber Eats Twitter Sentiment Analysis</b><br>
                                I performed sentiment analysis by using Python code (TwitterAPI) to crawl tweets from Twitter to compare the popularity between the two food delivering services in the New York area, thereby giving
                                recommendation to improve their business. I'm planning to do one analysis for Seamless as well, mainly because  I love its awesome ads on the MTA subway.<br>
                                Grubhub is more popular on Twitter than Uber Eats. I zeroed in on particular geographic location (Greater New York Metropolitan area) by analyzing competitors, major customer complaints, most popular foods, influencers, and visualizing analytic result.
                                <br><br>
                                <b>2. Predicting Citi Bike Trip Duration Using Data Mining Algorithms</b><br>
                                I love Citi Bike. If you live in New York City you must know that it feels absolutely wonderful to bike around Central Park and by the Hudson river in the fall. It's like you're in a movie and that anything is possible.  
                                So I took this large dataset released by Citi Bike and did some modeling with it, hoping to get some insight.<br>

                                I tested out Decision Tree, Neural Network, Logistic Regression models using Python and SPSS Modeler to predict ridersâ trip duration with an 61% of accuracy.
                                They could improve their pricing strategy of surcharging and reducing the free period for subscribers to fall closer to trip duration.<br><br>
                                <b>3. Stock Portfolio Optimization Using Sharpe Ratio</b><br>
                                Using Python packages, creating an investment portfolio among S&P500 stocks with the highest risk-adjusted return using the optimal Sharpe ratio, scraping historical data from Yahoo Finance, uploading it to a PostgreSQL server and querying it back to perform visualization and analysis. I hope that one day I could retire early and live off my passive investment income.
                                <br><br>
                                <b>4. Analyzing Wine Reviews using Text Analytics and Machine Learning</b><br>
                                I did this as a weekend project, stemming from my own curiosity to what the expert sommeliers have to say about different wines in different parts of the world (because who doesn't love wine?). I applied sentiment analysis, several text parsing methods like stop-word removal and n-grams to discover the pattern of these reviews.
                                <br><br>
                                <b>5. Employee Attrition Prediction</b><br>
                                A lot of exploratory data analysis here. I just want to showcase my visualization skills :). But of course I still prefer Tableau and Looker to matplotlib and other python visualization packages.

                            <p>I worked on a team of five and won first place in the 2018 Fordham Consulting Case Competition against 14 other teams.
                                We proposed strategic recommendation on changes to management structure, customer journey, and product strategy for the company MongoDB - a NoSQL database company ahead of its IPO.<br><br>
                                
                                Participants in the case competition were randomized into teams and had 2 weeks to complete a report and a Powerpoint proposal to present in front of faculty and industry professionals.<br><br>
                                
                                I self-taught Bloomberg Terminal within that timeframe to get up-to-date market and industry data to support the analysis.

                            <p> <i>Originally posted on my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/march-data-crunch-madness-experience-science-student-katie-linh-cao/">LinkedIn</a>.</i>
                                <br><br>
                                April 11, 2019.
                                <br><br>
                                This past Monday saw the 2019 NCAA Menâs Basketball Champion â Virginia Cavaliers, after beating Texas Tech in overtime. It was a heart-throbbing experience for me personally watching the championship game, especially during that 5-minute overtime, or when the main game stood at a tie (68-68).
                                <br><br>
                                    I was extra thrilled for this year's tournament as my classmates and I competed against 35 other teams in the March Data Crunch Madness competition held by Fordham University Business Analytics program and sponsored by Deloitte, mirroring Google Cloud & NCAA annual competition â Applying Machine Learning to NCAA March Madness.
                                    <br><br>
                                    I would not get into the technicality of the model that we built as itâs worth a separate post, but rather focus on general takeaways that I have learned from the competition and the tournament:
                                    <br><br>
                                    1. The name âMarch Madnessâ holds true. Biggest Elite Eight upsets in tournament history.
                                    <br><br>
                                    2. Perseverance and redemption: UVA earned this championship. Did you know that in 2018 March Madness, top seed UVA was out in the very first round by losing to seed 16 UMBC?
                                    <br><br>
                                    3. Yet luck is still a major component for Virginia Cavaliers. Top seed Duke lost to Michigan State in Elite Eight (67-68), alas.
                                    <br><br>
                                    4. Predicting bracket is a personal journey. Be it your collegeâs team, your hometown, your dog picked the bracket, or your unwavering support for the underdogs. To each their own, we all have our own methodology to predict the bracket. For my team, we simply let the data speak. We wholeheartedly trusted the model and did not alter our code even when we favored a losing team. Our log loss came out to be 0.49.
                                    <br><br>
                                    5. Some important variables that play a big role in predicting the bracket:<br>
                                    - Team seed<br>
                                    - Final and Preseason AP Poll Ranking<br>
                                    - Coach Poll ranking before the final (Hereâs an interesting Tableau visualization on college basketball coachesâ salary)<br>
                                    - Opponent's shooting percentage on 3 point field goals<br>
                                    - Points scored per 100 offensive possessions<br>
                                    - Estimate of offensive efficiency & Estimate of defensive efficiency (especially how one factor offsets the other factor of the opponent in a game - classic offense vs. defense in basketball)
                                    <br><br>
                                    6. You might think the fanciest machine learning model will be the most optimal option. Well, think again. The devil is in the details. Getting the bracket right requires a good understanding of basketball, statistics, creativity in engineering new features, ability to grid search and tune your hyperparameters, and ultimately, luck. Winners of first year's Kaggle March Madness competition published a paper detailing their method, using good ol' logistic regression. Personally, my team tested a few simple models and went with Random Forest Classifier.
                                    <br><br>
                                    7. Power of visualization and story-telling. No matter how fancy the machine learning model might be, ultimately it comes down to the Final Four prediction (which only 0.02% of people got it right this year) and the ability to explain the model and findings to judges, who may or may not come from technical background, be an avid basketball fan, or love a good Tableau visualization. FiveThirtyEight (one of my favorite data-driven news sources) did a fantastic job once again with its 2019 march madness bracketology project including an interactive visualization here.
                                    <br><br>
                                    8. Some other interesting techniques that I observed from other participating teams:<br>
                                    - Introduce numbers of NBA draft per team as a variable<br>
                                    - Incorporate legal sport betting data into the model as a variable<br>
                                    - Use âDark Horseâ analogy to predict upsets<br>
                                    - Apply genetic algorithm to the model
                                    <br><br>
                                    9. Fun fact: My team's prediction for Elite Eight and Final Four matches exactly with the prediction of Adobe Analytics.
                                    <br><br>
                                    10. Limitation:<br>

                                    - Time and resources, or lack thereof: We did not have much time to say, deploy fancy models or come up with more creative features, or simply to beautify our codes just a little bit more. There's always another tournament the following year ...<br>
                                    - The model built is based heavily on features team seed, AP Ranking, and Coach Ranking. There should be a random noise feature added to account for upsets, especially in the last few matches.<br>
                                    - Bias in machine learning models: Models are black boxes. Even with an adequate understanding of the fundamental maths behind them, there's room for mistakes and biases. By assessing several methods to evaluate a model and keeping an open mind, only then can we commit to reducing biases.<br>
                                <br><br>
